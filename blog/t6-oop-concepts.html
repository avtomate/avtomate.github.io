    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming</h1>
    <h4>February 19, 2015</h4>

    <h2>What is Object-Oriented Programming?</h2>
    <p>
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in which data structures known as <em>objects</em>.  These objects are used to model real-world objects (such as humans, tree, and Pembroke Welsh Corgis.)  Problems are broken down into smaller and smaller pieces with the intention of being simpler and readily solvable. Objects are then made to interact with one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Common features of OOP include classes, inheritance, encapsulation (limiting access to particular object components), and dynamic dispatch (a method invocation will be dynamically determined by the object type) and data mutability (data is readily changable.)
    </p>


    <h2>What is Functional Programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm in which functions are evaluated without changing state or manipulating data structures (in stark contrast to OOP).  By minimizing state changes, program behavior is often more easier to predict and understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common features of FP include higher-order functions (functions that accept other functions as their arguments), purity (side-effects are minimized, making errors less common in theory), and immutable data (data structures are copied and manipulating, but the originals are not changed.)
      </p>

    <h2>TL;DR Me Please</h2>
    <p>
      Both paradigms have different schools of thought between the relationship of data on operations on said data.  For OOP, data and operations are tightly coupled, and focus is placed on these data objects interacting with one-another.  For FP, data is loosely coupled to operations (functions), and the focus is on operations rather than changing the data structures.  Many programming languages feature elements from several paradigms.
