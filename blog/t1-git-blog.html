  <h2>Week 1 - Experiences with Git, GitHub and Version Control</h2>

      <b>What are the benefits of Version Control?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Version Control Systems (VCS) are so ubiquitous that aspiring programmers may wonder why  we even bother to learn all these seemingly arcane shell commands to manage a VCS like git - why can't we just save the latest and greatest build of our code?  But VCS usage is common for good reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      First and foremost, a good VCS insures that critical flaws to your code base can be rolled back to functional states.  I suspect it’s all too common for developers to release code that ostensibly works, even in a test-driven environment, only to find that it introduces a whole bunch of errors (looking at you, iOS 8.0.1!)  Thankfully, worst comes to worst, a faulty version can simply be rolled back to an earlier, functional version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, a VCS allows for better workflow.  Imagine you are an adept programmer working on some gigantic enterprise software solution.  You have a team of 20 developers working in tandem, all across the office, on the same code base.  It would be preposterous to try and edit the same documents all at once.  Tossing the thumb drive around, or having your coworker delete your precious code in some cloud IDE because it was too verbose for their liking - it just couldn’t work.  While you spend several hours refactoring one portion, your coworker has already created conflicting code that undermines your earlier work.  It stands to reason then that every person be granted their own iteration of the software to edit simultaneously as they see fit, and then submit that work for later integration to the master branch.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> How does git help you keep track of changes? </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Git, a specific type of VCS, helps keep track of changes by allowing developers to comment their commits.  So instead of blindly looking up past versions, developers can intelligently and systematically view the changes introduced with each commit.
    <p>
      <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      But why GitHub, Mike?  I was under the assumption that programmers sit in their dark cubicles for days on end crushing code that solves obscure computer science problems?  Why would they actually want to “code socially”?  GitHub is wonderful for many reasons, but primarily in that it facilitates open source development and tacitly shames you into submitting code every day (correction: I meant “encourages”).  I may know very little Ruby at present moment, but that doesn’t mean I can’t try and refactor parts of metasploit’s source code to help the whole project!  When humanity can stop reinventing the wheel daily with proprietary software and start sharing their contributions via open source repos like those found on GitHub, perhaps the world will be a better place.  Or maybe RMS has brainwashed me.  And before you call me an anti-capitalist idealist, I cite WordPress as a case study in showing that you can provide open source software while still effectively monetizing what you’ve developed.
