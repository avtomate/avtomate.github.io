    <h1>Ruby Classes: <i>Bear</i>ly Understood</h1>
    <h4>February 12, 2015</h4>

    <h2>What Are Classes?</h2>
    <p>
      I think I speak for everyone when I say the ideal text-based RPG would have
      characters that are only bears. I'd want these characters to have many
      shared abilities, talents, and traits, but ultimately be unique when and
      where I deem it appropriate.  But rewriting every single bear to have a
      method to "roar" and another method to "hibernate" would be terribly redundant.
      Thankfully, we have "classes" in Ruby which allow us to create new instances
      of classes that possess the classes' methods and characteristics.
