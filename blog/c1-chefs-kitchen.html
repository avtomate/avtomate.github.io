  <h2>Week 1 - Thoughts about beginning DBC, adequacy fears, general mindset.</h2>

      Going into Dev Bootcamp, I’m highly optimistic.  I’ve recently begun to believe that anything is learnable with enough time and the belief that you can learn it (call it saccharin, but it took me 4 completions of the Codecademy Ruby track to be comfortable with Ruby.)  I’ve paid the tuition.  I’ve left my other career prospects.  I’ve begun forcing myself to learn programming in Starbucks from 9 - 6pm daily independent of whether or not my weekly work is done.  There’s no turning back, and I couldn’t be more excited.

      My impression of DBC is that it is a dynamic and holistic learning environment (I’m hesitant to use ‘holistic’ as faux-medicine practices comes to mind - but this is the real deal!)  So many times I’ve been in a work environment and thought “this last interaction could’ve been handled with more finesse/more intelligently”, and I’m glad that’s an emphasis.  I love that the curriculum seems to be ever-evolving.  I’m concerned with the emphasis on Rails, which has been losing favor among startups.  But as most veteran developers have told me - don’t focus on which languages are trending.  Learn the principles and concepts of computer science in any language, and suddenly learning new languages isn’t as daunting.

      I’m cautiously optimistic regarding the “engineering empathy” component.  I think meditating and positive, thoughtful interpersonal communication will be a huge boon as a developer, but if I may be so bold, I’m nervous that the EE component will be curried with partisan political beliefs.  It always amazed me in college how brazen some teachers were in injecting their own political beliefs into otherwise objective lectures - but we’ll see!

      Learning to program has been the most intellectually humbling endeavor I’ve ever experienced.  You may fancy yourself smart until someone asks you to solve a computer science-related question in a foreign language.  It’s funny how my self confidence goes from an all-time high because I’m learned how to use terminal commands, to a complete low when I realize how far behind your average software developer I am.  There are brilliant people out there that’ve been doing this stuff for decades, and it’s like breathing to them.  But I can’t change that, and thus I can’t concern myself with it.

      I’m most nervous about falling behind the curriculum.  I’m hard working and quick to pick things up, but it’s just an inescapable fear.  I’m willing and able to dedicate enough time though that that hopefully will never come to fruition.  I’m also nervous that I’ll enter the workforce, but won’t be taken seriously relative to my peers with a degree in computer science.  I believe the curriculum teaches computer science, but I’ll still be lacking the diploma.  Nevertheless, I believe DBC will in fact make me a world-class beginner, and I can’t wait to take control of my learning at DBC.

      Disclaimer: I’m pretty new.  I’m sure my opinions will change as I learn more (at least I’d hope so!)
