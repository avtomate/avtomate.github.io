    <h1>The Scourge of Legacy Software</h1>
    <h4>February 5, 2015</h4>

    <p>Why is the American banking infrastructure so awful?  This week's
      cultural blog post will be touching upon an issue in technology.  The
      first thing that crossed my mind are the issues of legacy software, and
      jointly how short-sighted business goals negatively impact coding
      decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Legacy Software?</h2>
    <p>
      Legacy software consists of software that utilizes old methodologies, paradigms, or languages.  Some issues associated with such software is that the software may only run on antiquated hardware, increasing maintainence costs.
      Another issue is that as software evolves, there becomes less of a talent pool to draw from to help manage and update such software.  Another issue is that legacy systems can have vulnerabilities due to their running on dated operating systems.  The final major issue legacy systems face is that they may struggle to integrate with newer systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      So often times software will be developed using languages that will not be in demand decades down the line (looking at you COBOL!), and end-users (and programmers!) will suffer.  Hence why I can't instantly send money from my bank account using the bank's systems, but I can through a phone app (legal barriers also limit what banks' systems are capable of.)
    </p>

    <p>
      But how can we ameliorate the issue of legacy software?  The software could periodically be updated, being translated to contemporary languages using best-practice paradigms.  But keep in mind that giant legacy codebases are a hodgepodge of band aids and tape holding together something that even the most brilliant software architects can't fully grasp.  And thus, trying to convert the legacy code into a new language may wind up creating more problems than it solves.  Such a conversion for a large project is also ridiculously expensive and time consuming, and financial gains may take years to offset the costly decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      So in the end, there's no real simple solution.  What can be done is that all programmers focus on creating code that is accessible, follows best practices/paradigms, and has some chance of being useful and understood decades from when it is written.  But until such actions are incentivized, as opposed to myopic project completions, we may not see such best practices.
