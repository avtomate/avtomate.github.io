    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h4>February 21, 2015</h4>

    <h2>What is Stereotype Threat?</h2>
    <p>
      Stereotype threat is the phenomenon in which groups of people who are subject to negative stereotypes are at risk for confirming said stereotypes.  The issue is enhanced when salient features of their group are brought to their attention (such as asking for one's gender prior to taking a math test.)
    </p>

    <p>
      I can't think of a time where I've been negatively impacted by this.  I recognize that others may be subject to it, and I think that will be helpful in not playing into it.
    </p>

    <p>
      On a personal level, I can't think of anyway to combat this that would have me behave any differently (it's already inappropriate to attribute one's inability to their gender/race.)  On a grander scale, some solutions that would reduce stereotype threat without any negative externalities would be to ask for one's race and gender after taking a test, as opposed to asking prior.  Per the original work done by Steel and Aronson, the threat is reduced when one is not reminded of one's race/gender prior to test-taking.  Accordingly, doing it after should remove its negative effects.
