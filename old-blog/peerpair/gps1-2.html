         <p><b>What is pair programming?</b></p>
         <p>
            Pair programming is a way for two or more people to collaborate
            writing code while ensuring mutual understand and allowing for two
            sets of eyes to troubleshoot.  The process usually includes one
            person giving general instruction and guidance while the other
            person typing the actual code under the first person's instruction.
         </p>
         <br>

         <p><b>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</b></p>
         <p>
            Pair programming allows you to learn from another person and share
            what you've learned.  It also helps you catch errors more quickly,
            which is good for debugging and saving time in the long-run.  It's
            also good practice communicating.
         </p>

         <p><b>Driver vs Navigator</b></p>
         <p>
            The driver is physically typing out the code as per the navigator's
            instructions.  The navigator acts as the leader giving abstract,
            generalized instructions to the driver.
