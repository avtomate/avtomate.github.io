    <h1>Cultural Blog: Pairing and Feedback</h1>
    <h4>February 12, 2015</h4>

    <h3>Pairing</h3>
    <p>
      I've now been able to pair program on about a dozen or so different problems.  And without fail, whether I was changing the font color in CSS or thinking about how to create an ideal control flow statement to account for two competing demands (looking at you, weird bakery problem!): I don't like the prospect of looking dumb.  It's one thing to sit down and code on your own, where you're the only critic.  But when you pair program, you have another set of eyes watching your every decision.  It's surprising how much this negatively impacts your performance, even when you otherwise know what you're doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      A particular social psychology finding comes to mind - that well-learned task performance is enhanced in the presence of others, and where novel or not-well-learned task performance is hindered by the presence of others.  Perhaps my fears are only because I don't feel quite as comfortable doing whatever it is I'm doing (I doubt I'll ever be comfortable given the pace of what we're learning though!)
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm not a big fan of when I know how to do something on an abstract level (e.g. alright double the value of every value whose index is divisible by three and is even), but I can't translate this desire to concrete code.  This should hopefully come around in time as I get more comfortable and knowledgable with the syntax.
    </p>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      When reading feedback, I feel pretty good.  It's mostly all been valuable, and I agree with nearly everything said.  I remember in <i>How To Win Friends And Influence People</i> how the author talks about how criticism is almost unnecessary - people know when they mess up and what they messed up on.  And that's very applicable here - I think we're all all-too-aware of when we've messed up.  But it certainly doesn't hurt to have it politely drawn to attention. Based upon past feedback, I plan to make sure I continue to learn the material in its entirety before I commit to a pairing session.  Writing feedback feels a bit stilted and redundant.  Most people seem to know where they can improve, but it's nice to be able to let the person be aware of where they could improve, as we may occasionally be unaware of our shortcomings.  The most difficult part of writing feedback is finding a valid criticism - most people are well-prepared and make valuable contributions, so it's hard to complain!
