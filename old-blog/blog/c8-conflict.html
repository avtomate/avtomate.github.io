    <h1>Identifying and Managing Conflict</h1>
    <h4>March 6, 2015</h4>

    <h2>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h2>
    <p>
      A while back I had a conflict with a friend over politics. We were discussing some tangential issues, and the conversation naturally moved into a generalized discussion of the political issue.  I'm not at liberty to say what the issue was, as my opinion is unpopular and I wouldn't want to compromise future employment prospects over it.
    </p>

    <h2>What was the source of the conflict?</h2>
    <p>
      The source of the conflict was our divergent view points.  Neither of us was inherently wrong our right.  We've had different lives and accordingly have different world views.  Much like asking someone's favorite color, people will disagree, but there's no objectively "best" color.  It's all a matter of opinion mostly far removed from facts or rationale.
    </p>

    <h2>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h2>
    <p>
      Anger - albeit very mild and controllable.  My friend's view was just at ends with who I fundamentally am.  People will disagree, and I'm fine with that, it's just upsetting to hear someone profess something that negatively impacts your life in a very real way.
    </p>

    <h2>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h2>
    <p>
      Stopped talking about the issue.  I know most people would love to hear it was peacefully resolved and the more "ignorant" of us two was able to be enlightened and see the error in their ways, but that's not usually what happens.  Politics and religion aren't really appropriate for day-to-day conversation among friends/professionals, and I've never once had a productive dialogue about those two topics in casual conversation.  It's just polarizing, so I tend to avoid such conversations.
    </p>

    <h2>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h2>
    <p>
      Not get started in discussing politics.  Even if you "win" the argument, nothing has changed other than your friend now feels more alienated.
    </p>

    <h2>What did you learn from this experience?</h2>
    <p>
      It's inappropriate to discuss political issues in the work place.  Casual dialogues are usually unproductive when it comes to politics and religion.  While I remain open to conversations, I've not seen anyone's opinion ever changed by such a conversations.
