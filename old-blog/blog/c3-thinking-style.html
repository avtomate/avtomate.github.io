    <h3>My Gregorc Thinking Style As It Relates to DBC</h2>

    <p>My Gregorc Thinking Style is best described as Concrete Random.  Although I'm a bit uncertain as to the validity of this measure (this strikes me as being eerily similar to my horoscope), the descriptors it uses are consistent with how I prefer to learn.  Concrete Random is described as enjoying experimentation to find answers, one who takes risks, uses intuition, and enjoys solving problems independently.
    </p>

    <p>
      While at Dev Bootcamp, I'll need to capitalize on all these qualities while trying to become more comfortable working in groups (or more importantly, pairs).  Peer pairing is an integral part of the DBC experience, and I need to remain open to the practice (as much as I'd like to just sit by myself for 8 hours coding.)
    </p>

    <p>
      My biggest struggle thus far has been persistance when faced with an issue I can't seem to understand. I consider myself intelligent and hardwork, and when I'm faced with something I can't understand after trying several times, it can be a bit disheartening.  Some mental strategies I've been developing have been to always remember that <b>everything</b> is learnable, one just needs enough time and to see it presented in different ways.  Having the patience to do so is what'll be so important for me in the future.

    <h3>Fixed vs Growth Mindset</h3>

    <p>
      I can most succintly describe fixed and growth mindsets by saying the former is a mindset where anything can be learned with enough time and effort in spite of failure, and the latter shys away from learning anything that may seem insurmountable at first.  I'm still a recovering growth mindset guy.  But I'm slowly coming around after witnessing time and time again how persistence allows me to learn things that have otherwise baffled me for hours at a time.  I just need to remain conscious of that one belief, and not feel sorry for myself when I'm struggling.  There's nothing that interferes with personal growth quite like self-pity.
