    <h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h4>February 22, 2015</h4>

    <h2>Values I Value</h2>
    <p>
      For my assignment in combatting stereotype threat, I will explore the values that have led me to feel the happiest.  Some values that allow me to be my happiest include autonomy, efficiency, fairness, and persistence.  In general, I try to live up to these values, but I find myself being less efficient than I'd like to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      The value that's most important to me is autonomy.  Being able to complete one's work without necessarily relying on others has always been of great appeal to me.  I cannot effectively control the efforts/actions/attitudes of others, but I am always in control of myself, and so I am at my best when I can work on my own.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last topic someone asked me for advice on was commitment, more specifically, on how to work for hours on end towards some greater end-goal.  I've not yet mastered the art myself, but all achievements are just the sum of small habits.  My advice is to just make unfaultering commitments to minor habits (e.g. reading for 5 minutes every day), and then progressively building upon them until you're where you'd like to be (e.g. reading for 60 minutes every day.)

    <p>
      I think the greatest realization thus far has been that with enough time, everything is learnable.  Accordingly, I shouldn't get discouraged when a person is ostensibly more knowledgable about CS/programming than I am.  Even if someone can learn x in one hour when the same learning takes me 3 hours, I can still be more knowledgable by putting in more time and effort.  When I'm feeling down, I just need to remind myself to keep a stiff upper-lip and keep moving forward.  It sounds cliche, but it's what works.
